	How to add icons to Visual Studio project

To add icons to your project, you should add them to project resources:
	
	'projectname' -> right mouse button click -> Properties -> Resources -> Icons -> Add resources.
	
Icons should be in a specified folder. They will appear in solution explorer, with the other source files.
Click each of them and in properties window in field 'Build Action' choose 'Resource'.
Then you have to add it, for example, to window resources, that way:

        <Window.Resources>
          <Image x:Key="imagineyourownkey" Source="Resources/*.ico"/>
          .......
        </Window.Resources>
        
After this stuff is done, choose, for example, MenuItem component, and place {StaticResource yourkey} in its' 'Icon' property.
Click 'Rebuild solution'.
Well done!
